# TweetTag

## How to use TweetTag

When you open the app, you are told that you are not following anything. Tap the "bookmarks" button in the top left corner. You are brought to the "Tags" page, where you can add, remove, and check/uncheck tags. Tap "+" in the top right corner to add a hashtag. Type in your tag and tap save. You can add as many tags as you'd like. Tags can be checked or unchecked by tapping, and they can be deleted by sliding left.

When you are finished, tap "Done" in the top left. All tweets with any of your checked off tags will be shown. You can use the button in the top right to sort. You can view recent tweets, popular tweets, or a mix of the two. Scroll up to refresh, and scroll all the way to the bottom to load more. Tap on a user's profile picture to open their Twitter profile page. Tap on any link to open it.
